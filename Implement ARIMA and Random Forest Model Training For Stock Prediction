Implement ARIMA and Random Forest model training for stock prediction

This commit adds functions to train ARIMA and Random Forest models for predicting future stock levels.

-   `train_ARIMA`: Uses `auto_arima` for automated ARIMA model selection and includes error handling and logging.
-   `train_RandomForest`: Implements a Random Forest Regressor with `MinMaxScaler` normalization and a train/test split for evaluation.
