Transfer Pricing Regulations on International Transactions.
1. Arm's Length Price.—The arm's length price, referred to in Section 104(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of
2006, for the purpose of ascertaining profits and income arising, derived or accruing from or loss incurred in any transaction
entered into between two associated undertakings shall be determined by any of the following methods, being the most
appropriate method :-
(a) comparable uncontrolled price method
under this method,
(i) the price charged or paid for property transferred or services provided in a comparable uncontrolled
transaction, or a number of such transactions, is identified ;

PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 12.08.2013
(ii) such price is adjusted to account for differences, if any between the transaction and the comparable
uncontrolled transactions or between the undertakings, entering into such transactions, which could
materially affect the price in the open market ;
(iii) the adjusted price so arrived at is taken to be an arm's length price in respect of the property transferred
or services provided in the transaction ;
(b) resale price method
under this method
(i) the price at which property purchased or services obtained by the undertaking from an associated
undertaking is resold or are provided to an unrelated enterprise, is identified ;
(ii) such resale price is reduced by the amount of a normal gross profit margin accruing to the enterprice
or to an unrelated enterprise from the purchase and resale of the same or similar property or from
obtaining and providing the same or similar services, in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a
number of such transactions ;
(iii) the price so arrived at is further reduced by the expenses incurred by the undertaking in connection
with the purchase of property or obtaining of services ;
(iv) the price so arrived at is adjusted to take into account the functional and other differences, including
differences in accounting practices, if any, between the transaction and the comparable uncontrolled
transactions, or between the enterprices entering into such transactions, which could materially
affect the amount of gross profit margin in the open market ;
(v) the adjusted price arrived at under sub-paragraph (iv) of this paragraph is taken to be an arm's length
price in respect of the purchase of the property or obtaining of the services by the undertaking from
the associated undertaking ;
(c) cost plus method
under this method
(i) the direct and indirect costs of production incurred by the undertaking in respect of property transferred
or services provided to an associated undertaking, are determined ;
(ii) the amount of a normal gross profit mark-up to such costs (computed according to the same accounting
norms) arising from the transfer or provision of the same or similar property or services by the
undertaking, or by an unrelated enterprise, in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of
such transactions, is determined ;
(iii) the normal gross profit mark-up referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph is adjusted to take
into account the functional and other differences, if any, between the transaction and the comparable
uncontrolled transactions, or between the undertakings entering into such transactions, which could
materially affect such profit mark-up in the open market ;
(iv) the costs referred to in sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph are increased by the adjusted profit
make-up arrived at under sub-paragraph (iii) of this paragraph ;
(v) the sum so arrived at is taken to be an arm's length price in relation to the supply of the property or
provision of services by the undertaking ;I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2013'08'12 3A
PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 12.08.2013
(d) Profit split method
This method may be applicable mainly to international transactions involving transfer of unique intangibles
or in multiple international transactions which are so interrelated that they cannot be evaluated separately
for the purpose of determing the arm's length price of any one transaction, by which -
(i) the combined net profit of the associated undertaking arising from the international transaction in
which they are engaged, is determined ;
(ii) the relative contribution made by each of the associated undertaking to the earning of such combined
net profit, is then evaluated on the basis of the functions performed, assets employed or to be
employed and risks assumed by each undertaking and on the basis of reliable external market data
which indicates how such contribution would be evaluated by unrelated enterprise performing
comparable functions in similar circumstances ;
(iii) the combined net profit is then split amongst the undertakings in proportion to their relative
contributions, as evaluated under sub paragraph (ii) of this paragraph ;
(iv) the profit thus apportioned to the assessee is taken into account to arrive at an arm's length price in
relation to the transaction :
Provided that the combined net profit referred to in sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph may, in the
first instance, be partially allocated to each undertaking so as to provide it with a basic return appropriate
for the type of transaction in which it is engaged, with reference to market returns achieved for similar
types of transactions by independent enterprises, and thereafter, the residual net profit remaining
after such allocation may be split amongst the undertakings in proportion to their relative contribution
in the manner specified under sub-paragraph (ii) and (iii), of this paragraph, and in such a case the
aggregate of the net profit allocated to the undertaking in the first instance together with the residual
net profit apportioned to that undertaking on the basis of its relative contribution shall be taken to be
the net profit arising to that undertaking from the transaction ;
(e) transactional net margin method —
under this method,
(i) the net profit margin realized by the undertaking from a transaction entered into with an associated
undertaking is computed in relation to costs incurred or sales effected or assets employed or to be
employed by the undertaking or having regard to any other relevant base ;
(ii) the net profit margin realized by the undertaking or by an unrelated enterprise from a comparable
uncontrolled transaction or a number of such transactions is computed having regard to the same
basis ;
(iii) the net profit margin referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph arising in comparable uncontrolled
transactions is adjusted to take into account the differences, if any, between the transaction and the
comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the undertakings entering into such transactions,
which could materially affect the amount of net profit margin in the open market ;
(iv) the net profit margin realized by the undertaking and referred to in sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph
is established to be the same as the net profit margin referred to in sub-paragraph (iii) of this
paragraph ;
(v) the net profit margin thus established is then taken into account to arrive at an arm's length price in
relation to the transaction.4A I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2013'08'12
PART I : SEC. (I) - GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA - 12.08.2013
Provided that where more than one price is determined as the most appropriate method, the arm's length
price shall be taken to be the arithmetical means of such prices.
Provided further that if the variation between the arm's length price so determined and price at which the
transaction has actually been undertaken does not exceed three percent of the latter, the price at which the
transaction has actually been undertaken shall be deemed to be the arm's length price.
2. For the purposes of Regulation 1, the comparability of a transaction with an uncontrolled transaction shall be
judged with reference to the following :-
(a) the specific characteristics of the property transferred or services provided in either transaction ;
(b) the functions performed, taking into account assets employed or to be employed and the risks assumed, by
the respective parties to the transaction ;
(c) the contractual terms (whether or not such terms are formal or in writing) of the transactions which lay down
explicitly or implicitly how the responsibilities, risks and benefits are to be divided between the respective
parties to the transactions ;
(d) conditions prevailing in the markets in which the respective parties to the transactions operate, including
the geographical location and size of the markets, the laws and Government orders in force, costs of labour
and capital in the markets, overall economic development and level of competition and whether the markets
are wholesale or retail.
3. An uncontrolled transaction shall be comparable to a transaction, if
(i) none of the differences, if any, between the transactions being compared, or between the undertaking
entering into such transactions are likely to materially affect the price or cost charged or paid in, or the profit
arising from, such transactions in the open market ; or
(ii) reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the material effects of such differences.
The data to be used in analyzing the comparability of an uncontrolled transaction with a transaction shall be the
data relating to the year of assessment in which the transaction has been entered into ;
Provided that data relating to a period not being more than two years prior to such year assessment may also be
considered if such data reveals facts which could have an influence on the determination of transfer prices in
relation to the transactions being compared.
4. Most appropriate method :
(a) For the purposes of Regulation 1, the most appropriate method shall be the method which is best suited to
the facts and circumstances of each particular transaction, and which provides the most reliable measure of
an arm’s length price in relation to the transaction.
(b) In selecting the most appropriate method, the following factors shall be taken into account, namely :-
(i) the nature and class of the transaction ;
(ii) the class or classes of associated undertakings entering into the transaction and the functions
performed by them taking into account the assets employed or to be employed and risks assumed by
such undertakings ;
(iii) the availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for application of the method ;I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2013'08'12 5A

6. Advance Pricing Agreements (APA).—With a view to supplement the traditional administrative, judicial and
treaty mechanism for resolving transfer pricing issues, arrangements have been made for entering into an advance pricing
agreement in accordance with an appropriate set of criteria (e.g. method, appropriate adjustments thereto, and critical
assumption as to the future events) for controlled transactions for the determination of the transfer pricing for those
transactions over a fixed period of time.I fldgi ( ^I& fPoh - YS% ,xld m%cd;dka;s%l iudcjd§ ckrcfha w;s úfYI .eiÜ m;%h - 2013'08'12 7A

arrangement without involvement of other interested tax administrations though it may affect the tax
liability of the associated enterprise in other tax jurisdictions ;
(b) Bilateral Arrangement : It is an arrangement in which two or more countries concur in regard to transfer
pricing methodology to be adopted. The bilateral or multilateral approach is considered equitable to all tax
administrations and taxpayers and provides greater certainty to the taxpayer concerned.
